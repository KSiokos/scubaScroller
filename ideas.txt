Project Ideas
-------------

High score system 
	Leaderboard in main menu
AI implemented 
	Depth control creature creation (e.g. green jellyfish etc)
		E.g. 1000m shark spawns going across the screen
	Also jellyfish gradually move faster as time increases 
	Player can be moved faster after time progresses?
Projectiles (bubbles stop creatures from moving)
Then MASK collision with bubbles causes them to pop and releases jellyfish unless 10 seconds pass 
Make plastic collection more useful
Collisions with rocks 
	Health goes down 
Adding JellyFish Types at each interval of 50m depth
